This is the tutorial from google developer community wrt to google calender and use of nodejs to retrieve the events from the calender.

Please follow the link to build this app in nodejs

https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/nodejs


1) After following these steps please make a express app 

2) I have use the ejs template please replace the jade template with the ejs template

3) And copy the code of quickstart.js which you hade made with the help of previous tutorial to index.js in express app.

4)Make a different route and different template page to display the number of events.


Note-->In the above tutorial when we have to copy the code,we have to go to a url and copy the code and than paste it.

5)I had made the file(url.txt) in which the url is entered you can copy it from there and also paste the client_secret.json file in the express app where package.json lie. 


6)Now see the routes/index.js file and views/show.ejs for the code and also various other file for modification.

7)Use "npm start" to run the app,check the result on http://localhost:3000/.
